//21.	Maximum Attendance - A teacher wants to look at studentsâ€™ attendance data.
//  Given that there is a class , and the teacher has the record of the students present on n days of the month,
//  find the maximum number of consecutive days on which all students were present in the class.
//  Example
//  m=4
//  n=7
//  data=[PPPP, PPPP ,PPPP ,PPAP ,AAPP ,PAPA ,AAAA]
//  There are 4 students and 7 days attendance data . There are only three days, at the beginning where all students are present. Student 3 is absent on the fourth day , and students 1 and 2 are absent on the fifth day , and students 2 and 4 are absent on the sixth day and all are absent on the last day.
//  The maximum number of consecutive days on which all the students were present in the class is 3 days long.
